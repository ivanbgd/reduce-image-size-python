# Reduce Image Size

Reduces size of images in a folder (and optionally sub-folders, recursively).

Keeps the original images and creates copies with reduced file size.

Options:
- Look into subdirectories recursively: `--recursive`, `-r`
- Reduce both image dimensions by half: `--resize`

Tested on Windows 11 with JPEGs and PNGs.
